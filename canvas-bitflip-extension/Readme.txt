This is the failed extension that we tried to create

This one does not have the sliders as we were first just trying to get it to work and change the hash

It either ran into issues the the browser's CSP or did not run quick enough

To run this you just have to download this folder, go to chrome extension tab, turn on developer mode, click load unpacked, and select this folder.
