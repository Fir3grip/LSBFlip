# LSBFlip
The is the GitHub repo for CSEC 759. The project that was created for this class is a tool called LSBFlip. 
It blocks canvas fingerprinting by flipping the LSBs in the generated HTML5 canvas

canitrack_test contains the html file and test harness that were talked about during the presentation.
canvas-bitflip-extension contains the failed extension that we tried to create out of LSBFlip.
It does not contain any sliders yet because we were just trying to make it work.
